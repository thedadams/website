                <p>My projects fall into four categories: day job, freelance, math, and hobby. I try to limit myself to one
                    project at a time in each category so I don't get too bogged down. My interests are varied, but I am
                    usually working on things related to programming, education, mathematical research, or sports.

                <h3>Day Job</h3>
                <p>I am in my second year at St. Mary's Catholic High School. I am teaching physics, computer programming, calculus
                    I, and calculus II. In addition to my teaching responsibilities, I have been appointed to the "House
                    Dean" position, as well as math department chair. I am looking forward to being involved in the school
                    at another level.

                <h3>Freelance</h3>
                <p>St. Mary's has decided to adopt the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_system" target="_blank">House System</a>. I am developing the front and backend of an app to keep track of house, room, and student
                    points. The app also generates codes that teachers can handout to students for exhibiting positive qualities.
                </p>
                <p>The app is written in Go, using PostreSQL for the database, and hosted on Heroku.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Previously, I built and designed websites for clients. I also extended some functionality and improved automation
                    for a company which allowed them to grow much more quickly than they previously thought possible.

                <h3>Math</h3>
                <p>I am currently working towards finishing my PhD in math. It has taken me much longer than I anticipated,
                    but I am working on my dissertation problem and hope to complete it soon. My research is focused on algebraic
                    cycles on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Specifically, how homological and algebraic equivalence differ when
                    looking at codimension 1 cycles. We know that homological and algebraic equivalence are very different
                    for non-rigid Calabi-Yau threefolds. The proofs are analytic in nature, and we are seeking a purely algebraic
                    proof. The hope is that by finding such a proof, the rigid case would be more approachable.

                    it is down right now. I plan to finish it soon and run it for other to use. You can see my progress
