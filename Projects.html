                <p>My projects fall into four categories: day job, freelance, math, and hobby. I try to limit myself to one
                    project at a time in each category so I don't get too bogged down. My interests are varied, but I am
                    usually working on things related to programming, education, mathematical research, or sports.</p>

                <h3>Day Job</h3>
                <p>I recently accepted a full-time position teaching and developing curriculum at a high school. This is my
                    first teaching experience at the high school level and things are going well so far. I am teaching precalculus,
                    physics, and introduction to programming. This is the first time in a while that any sort of computer
                    programming is being offered at this high school. I am developing the curriculum on my own with guidance
                    from Dr. Eck's <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/" target="_blank" title="Intro to Programming using Java Book">Introduction to Programming using Java</a>.</p>

                <h3>Freelance</h3>
                <p>I don't have any freelance work right now. I have been speaking with a perspective client regarding some
                    consulting and technical work for their personal medical practice. This seems very promising and I look
                    forward to the possibility of learning more about technology in the medical field.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Previously, I built and designed websites for clients. I also extended some functionality and improved automation
                    for a company which allowed them to grow much more quickly than they previously thought possible.</p>

                <h3>Math</h3>
                <p>I am currently working towards finishing my PhD in math. It has taken me much longer than I anticipated,
                    but I am working on my dissertation problem and hope to complete it soon. My research is focused on algebraic
                    cycles on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Specifically, how homological and algebraic equivalence differ when
                    looking at codimension 1 cycles. We know that homological and algebraic equivalence are very different
                    for non-rigid Calabi-Yau threefolds. The proofs are analytic in nature, and we are seeking a purely algebraic
                    proof. The hope is that by finding such a proof, the rigid case would be more approachable.</p>

                <h3>Hobby</h3>
                <p>Right now my hobby project is a <a href="https://github.com/thedadams/cahbot" target="_blank" title="Cards Against Humanity bot">Cards Against Humanity bot</a>                    for the <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution" target="_blank" title="Telegram Bot Platform">Telegram Bot Platform</a>.
                    The bot has been functional for some time, but also abandoned for a couple reasons. The Telegram Bot
                    API has changed significantly since I began this project, and I would like to take advantage of some
                    of these changes and complete it.</p>
