                <p>My projects fall into four categories: day job, freelance, math, and hobby. I try to limit myself to one
                    project at a time in each category so I don't get too bogged down. My interests are varied, but I am
                    usually working on things related to programming, education, mathematical research, or sports.

                <h3>Day Job</h3>
                <p>I am in my second year at St. Mary's Catholic High School. I am teaching physics, computer programming, calculus
                    I, and calculus II. In addition to my teaching responsibilities, I have been appointed to the "House
                    Dean" position, as well as math department chair. I am looking forward to being involved in the school
                    at another level.

                <h3>Freelance</h3>
                <p>I decided to move my freelance work to an actual business. You can check out

                <p>Previously, I built and designed websites for clients. I also extended some functionality and improved automation
                    for a company which allowed them to grow much more quickly than they previously thought possible.

                <h3>Math</h3>
                <p>I am currently working towards finishing my PhD in math. It has taken me much longer than I anticipated,
                    but I am working on my dissertation problem and hope to complete it soon. My research is focused on algebraic
                    cycles on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Specifically, how homological and algebraic equivalence differ when
                    looking at codimension 1 cycles. We know that homological and algebraic equivalence are very different
                    for non-rigid Calabi-Yau threefolds. The proofs are analytic in nature, and we are seeking a purely algebraic
                    proof. The hope is that by finding such a proof, the rigid case would be more approachable.

                    it is down right now. I plan to finish it soon and run it for other to use. You can see my progress
