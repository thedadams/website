                <p>My projects fall into four categories: day job, freelance, math, and hobby. I try to limit myself to one project at a time in each category so I don't get too bogged down. My interests are varied, but I am usually working on things related to programming, education, mathematical research, or sports.

                <h3>Day Job</h3>
                <p>I am currently a Software Developer at <a href="https://acronis.com" target="_blank" title="Acronis">Acronis</a> in their Tempe,&nbsp;AZ office. They took a chance and hired me while I was teaching math at St.&nbsp;Mary's High School, and I am very grateful they did. I've enjoyed working as a professional developer, although I am a little surprised how similar it is to building software independently.

                <h3>Freelance</h3>
                <p>I decided to move my freelance work to an actual business. You can check out <a href="https://dadams.solutions" title="dadams solutions">dadams solutions llc</a> to get details.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Previously, I built and designed websites for clients. I also extended some functionality and improved automation for a company which allowed them to grow much more quickly than they previously thought possible.

                <h3>Math</h3>
                <p>I recently decided to discontinue pursuit of a PhD in mathematics. I will continue to read about and research mathematical topics. Right now, I am reviewing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwasawa_theory" target="_blank">Iwasawa Theory</a> in order to strengthen my Galois theory, class field theory, and homology theory knowledge.

                <h3>Hobby</h3>
                <p>I coach basketball in the winter. This keeps me very busy and I haven't been working on a hobby. However, I am going to get back on the wagon.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I am currently working on a <a href="http://www.telegram.org" title="Telegram">Telegram</a> bot to play Cards Against Humanity with friends. The game is currently functional, although it is down right now. I plan to finish it and run it for other to use. However, this was my first project in Go and the first one that utilized a database, so it also requires a lot of refactoring. You can see my progress <a href="https://github.com/thedadams/cahbot">here.</a>
