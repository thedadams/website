            <div class="sub-info">
                <p>My projects fall into four categories: day job, freelance, math, and hobby. I try to limit myself to one project at a time in each category so I don't get too bogged down. My interests are varied, but I am usually working on things related to programming, education, mathematical research, or sports.

                <h3>Day Job</h3>
                <p>I am in my second year at St. Mary's Catholic High School. I am teaching physics, computer programming, calculus I, and calculus II. In addition to my teaching responsibilities, I have been appointed to the "House Dean" position, as well as math department chair. I am looking forward to being involved in the school at another level.

                <h3>Freelance</h3>
                <p>I decided to move my freelance work to an actual business. You can check out <a href="https://dadams.solutions" title="dadams solutions">dadams solutions llc</a> to get details.

                <br>
                <p>Previously, I built and designed websites for clients. I also extended some functionality and improved automation for a company which allowed them to grow much more quickly than they previously thought possible.

                <h3>Math</h3>
                <p>I recently decided to discontinue pursuit of a PhD in mathematics. I will continue to read about and research mathematical topics. Right now, I am reviewing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwasawa_theory" target="_blank">Iwasawa Theory</a> in order to strengthen my Galois theory, class field theory, and homology theory knowledge.

                <h3>Hobby</h3>
                <p>I coach basketball in the winter. This keeps me very busy and I haven't been working on a hobby. However, I am going to get back on the wagon.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I am currently working on a <a href="http://www.telegram.org" title="Telegram">Telegram</a> bot to play Cards Against Humannity with friends. The game is currently functional, although it is down right now. I plan to finish it soon and run it for other to use. You can see my progress <a href="https://github.com/thedadams/cahbot">here.</a>
