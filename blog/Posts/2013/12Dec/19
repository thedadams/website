Giving Up Sports Betting For Now

<p>The time has come; I have to stop pursuing sports betting, but only temporarily.  I did have success.  I actually found a strategy that allowed me to win over 70% of the spread bets I made.  However, due to the lack of freely available statistics, it took me too long to compile the information each week.  If the information was programmatically easy to come by, I could continue this endeavor.</p>
<p>The information I need for basketball over/unders is "freely" available.  That is, I can get the statistics I need everyday without having to sit down and do it myself.  I wrote a few scripts and added a couple <code>launchd plists</code> to get the information I need.  The relevant statistics are then sent to my phone via <a href="http://pushover.com" target="_blank">PushOver</a>.  I can look at the match-ups at my leisure wherever I am.  I won't be publishing my results until I have more time to devote to the decision making process.</p>
<p>This was fun, and by no means am I done with sports betting.  If you do not know, I am a graduate student studying mathematics.  That is where I need to put my undivided attention at this time.  Once my dissertation is finished and I figure out what I want to do with my life (Hint: it won't be sports betting), I will pick it back up recreationally.</p>
<p>If you have been reading these entries, I thank you.  If you would like to know more about what I tired, what didn't work, and what did work, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
