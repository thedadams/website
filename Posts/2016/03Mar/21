Sleep Well

<p>I've struggled with my sleep for years.  I have gone through periods of great sleep, horrible sleep, or no sleep.  I use the <a href="http://www.sleepcycle.com" target="_blank" title="Sleep Cycle">Sleep Cycle</a> app to help me track my sleep and have been frustrated at being unable to break 60% sleep quality on a regular basis.  I've always heard that blue light from my computer and phone could be a reason why I wasn't sleeping well, but sometimes I need to work and getting away from my computer is not possible.  I recently came across <a href="http://lifehacker.com/get-better-sleep-and-start-mornings-strong-with-the-10-1762499118" target="_blank" title="10-3-2-1-0 Rule">this</a> article on Lifehacker and I learned that I needed to change when I wake up as well as what I do to wind down the day.</p>
<br>
<p>The aforementioned Lifehacker article outlines the "10-3-2-1-0" rules for getting better sleep.  The rules are as follows:</p>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>No caffeine within <strong>10</strong> hours of bedtime.</li>
    <li>No food or alcohol within <strong>3</strong> hours of bedtime.</li>
    <li>No more work within <strong>2</strong> hours of bedtime.</li>
    <li>Turn off all screens within <strong>1</strong> hour of bedtime.</li>
    <li>Hit the snooze button <strong>0</strong> times in the morning.</li>
</ul>
<p>One should notice that the frame of reference here is the time that you want to be in bed.  Something about adjusting my frame of reference helped me realize that I don't get a lot of work done between 18:00 and 21:00 each day because that is the time I walk the dog, have dinner, and spend time with my wife.  After this time, I have trouble getting back to work.  The remedy I came up with was to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier.  This had the affect of improving my sleep as well as maximizing my working hours.</p>
<br>
<p>My new daily routine is as follows: I set my Sleep Cycle alarm for 05:15 with a 30 minute window.  This allows me to shift my potentially unproductive working time after 21:00 to the morning when I am more focused and have fewer distractions.  With a bedtime of 22:00 in mind, the above rules dictate that I stop my caffeine intake at 12:00, abstain from food and alcohol after 19:00, stop working by 20:00, and turn off all screens at 21:00.  At this point, I get ready for bed so I can fall asleep quickly.  With the remaining time I have before my bedtime, I read a book (right now I am reading <u>Steve Jobs</u>).  I have no problem falling asleep, and Sleep Cycle reports that my sleep quality has improved.  Here are a before (left) and after (right) screenshot from Sleep Cycle as evidence of the improvement.</p>

<p>There are a couple things to note here.  First, in the after screenshot, you can see that I missed my goal bedtime.  I used this particular day's data because the bedtime, wake time, and sleep notes are similar in the two, however, the sleep qualities are not.  This is also reflected in how I feel when I wake up and my energy throughout the day.</p>
<br>
<p>The bottom line is that it is possible to help yourself sleep better and wake up more rested each day.  Doing so is difficult and takes discipline; I have already had to tell friends that I couldn't grab a beer with them because it was later than 19:00.  In my opinion, the productivity and energy I enjoy throughout my waking hours is worth the sacrifices I have made.  There is plenty of time for beer between 05:00 and 19:00.</p>
