Apple Watch

<p>I am the 2016 champion of my fantasy baseball league. This league is very competitive and I am glad that I have bragging rights for the next year. Bragging rights were not my only honor, however. A monetary award that covered the price of a 42mm Space Grey Aluminum Apple Watch accompanied my victory. I've been wearing it every day for the past 3 weeks and I am not impressed.</p>
<br>
<p>First, I want to say that I think smart watches are great. I wore a Kickstarter Edition Pebble for years before the screen went crazy. I loved that watch and was very disappointed when I put it in the drawer in my desk for good. Apple is very good at taking what others do and making it better so when it looked like I was going to win $500, I knew that I was going to use that money to purchase an Apple Watch. The Apple Watch is a huge upgrade over my original Pebble, but it is difficult for me to justify the price difference over the newest Pebbles.</p>
<br>
<p>The Pebble Time 2 (which is set to ship January 2017) has many of the features that the Apple Watch has including fitness tracking, heart rate monitor, voice reply, notifications, and water resistance (only 30 meters). The Pebble Time 2 also has better battery life, stainless steel body, and is much more customizable. The biggest difference is the price: the Pebble Time 2 is $170 cheaper than the least expensive Apple Watch and $200 cheaper than the one I purchased. I do get a few things for that extra money like touch screen, "Scribble" replies, Apple Pay, and a better looking product. At this time, I am not convinced that this is all worth it.</p>
<br>
<p>After coming to the realization that I wasn't 100% satisfied with my purchase, I decided to get the most out of my new Apple Watch. I installed a bunch of new apps. I use Apple Pay everywhere. I reply to text messages on my watch. I have even started running for exercise. Only one of these I could not do on a Pebble Time 2, but at least I feel like I am getting my money's worth out of my Apple Watch. Here's hoping that Apple improves the functionality with software updates.</p>
