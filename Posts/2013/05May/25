First Blog Post

<p>Hello to you.  My name is Donald Adams and I would like to welcome you to my blog.  One day, while reading one of my favorite iPhone/iPad blog, I ran across an article written about <a href="http://donmelton.com">Don Melton</a>.  He is best known for heading the Safari project at Apple.  He is retired now, but has chosen to share his thoughts and some of his experiences on his blog.  An interesting thing about Mr. Melton is he was not a "tech nerd" as a youngester.  He was actually once in seminary; you might not believe it if you listened to him on <a href="http://www.imore.com" target="_blank">iMore</a>'s <a href="http://www.imore.com/debug" target="_blank">Debug</a> podcast.  The point is he got a late start in computer programming and has inspired me to pursue it myself.  My first project was to code this blog.  My next post will describe how I did that.  For now, I would like to share little bit about myself.</p>
<br>
<p>I usually go by Donnie; I prefer not to be called Don (that's my dad).  I currently live in Tempe, AZ with my wife and my beagle.  I moved to Tempe to attend Arizona State University and pursue my Ph.D. in pure math.  Currently I am studying arithmetic geometry and number theory.  I moved from San Diego where I attended San Diego State for my bachelor's and master's degrees (both in math).  In case you don't know, number theory is the basis of cryptography including the kind used in computer communication.  As I learned the foundations of these cryptosystems, I naturally became interested in programming.  I just never thought of making it a career or a lifestyle.</p>
<br>
<p>I am also a huge sports fan.  I am especially interested in the emerging mathematics and statistics in sports analysis.  I follow a lot of different sports, but I enjoy baseball and basketball more than others.  I am very critical of (American) football and the issues that have come up in the NFL.  I am sure that there will be more than a few posts here expressing my feelings towards the NFL, its participants, and its fans.  My favorite teams are the San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Clippers, and Dallas Cowboys (maybe that's why I'm so critical of football).  I've followed these teams almost my entire life, and they will be my teams for the rest of it.</p>
<br>
<p>I already have a few ideas for my next posts.  Next, I will write about how I coded this blog.  It was definitely a learning experience I would like to share.  I have also been developing my own baseball statistic which attempts to measure how "streaky" hitters are in Major League Baseball.  I have yet to see anything like it on the popular statistical websites and I am very excited about the results I've been getting.  As soon as I am able to analyze the data more carefully, I will be posting some of the results here.</p>
