It's Been Awhile

<p>Wow, I can't believe I haven't written anything for this blog in nearly three years. A lot has happened in those three years -- a lot I want to write about -- but first I would like to just write a quick catch up.</p>
<br>
<p>The last post was just after my <a href="Post.html?post=2017-05May-13">step-father died</a>. Before that, I wrote about <a href="Post.html?post=2017-03Mar-30">my new full-time job</a>. Life has certainly changed since then. We were still getting used to the fact that my step-father was gone when we had more unexpected death in the family (more on that in a later post), and I know longer teach high school math (again, another post later). I've also interviewed at Google again, but nothing came of that.</p>
<br>
<p>One thing I can update here without another post is our new living situation. My wife and I bought a house in 2016. Since then, interest rates continued to fall and we decided to take advantage of this and the equity we built up in our house. We found a bigger house in a nicer neighborhood. Selling a house while trying to buy another one is not a fun process, but it was well worth it. Although our commutes are harder, I like nearly everything else about the new house. We even had a house-warming where all of our neighbors came.</p>
<br>
<p>Now that I am working from home for the foreseeable future because of the coronavirus pandemic, I plan to make writing and creative activities a priority in hopes that it sticks when life gets back to (the new) normal. I look forward to writing about the things that matter most to me.</p>
