                <h3>Pebble Watchfaces</h3>
                <p>I am the proud owner of a Kickstarter Edition Pebble Smartwatch. It no longer works and I have switched to
                    an Apple Watch, but I truly enjoyed my Pebble. To continue my journey of programming, I decided to write
                    a few watchfaces for my Pebble. You can read more about them <a href="http://thedadams.com/watchface/Watchfaces.html"
                        title="My Pebble Watchfaces">here</a>. The most popular one was the <a href="http://thedadams.com/watchface/Minimal.html"
                        title="Minimal Watchface">Minimal</a> watchface.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Pebble has since been purchased by Fitbit. I put all the code for these watchfaces on my <a href="https://github.com/thedadams"
                        title="Github account">Github account</a>.</p>

                <h3>Consistency Index</h3>
                <p>I have always been into sports, especially baseball. My father is a big baseball fan and definitely passed
                    that down to me. When I decided to teach myself to program, I waned my first project to involved math
                    and sports. This lead me to invent the Consistency Index (CI).</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are two versions of CI: one for batting average and one for on-base percentage. The general idea is
                    that "streaky" hitters will have long durations when they do well followed by long durations of no success.
                    On the other hand, consistent hitters will have success most of the time with very short periods of no
                    success. The CI uses this idea to attempt to distinguish between hitters that are consistent and inconsistent.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I would like to acknowledge a couple things. First, this is the project I used to teach myself how to program.
                    Therefore, the code is ugly. I hope to eventually clean it up, but for now you can view the project on
                    <a href="https://github.com/thedadams/ConsistencyIndex" title="Consistency Index on Github">Github</a>.
                    Secondly, as I have learned more about baseball and statistics, I realize that part of the idea is flawed.
                    For example, there is a weighting, but that weighting is essentially arbitrary. I hope to fix this one
                    day as well.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I wrote a few blog posts about it, which you can see <a href="http://blog.thedadams.com/Archive.html?tag=consistency+index"
