They leverage team work, discipline, hard work, and determination to learn the game of basketball, have fun, and compete at the highest level achievable.</p>

Therefore, in order to decrease the chances of that (or increase the chance of a rebound on offense), everybody must box-out and rebound the basketball. If the defense secures the ball, then...</p>

        <h3>Push the Pace</h3>
        <p>Good defense turns into good offense. In order to take advantage of a strong and persistent defense, the offensive must push the ball up the floor and look to attack. This isn't a "7 seconds or less" offense, but is a guide of where players should look first. If nothing materializes, then setup the offense.</p>
