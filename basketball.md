  <p class="text-lg mb-12">I have been proud to coach high school boys basketball since the 2017-18 season. I have experience as a Varsity assistant and head coach at the JV and Freshman levels.

They leverage team work, discipline, hard work, and determination to learn the game of basketball, have fun, and compete at the highest level achievable.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Rebound</h2>
        <p>Second chances are devastating to a defense. A team works hard to contest a shot only to give up an offensive rebound and have to do everything again. Therefore, in order to decrease the chances of that (or increase the chance of a rebound on offense), everybody must box-out and rebound the basketball. If the defense secures the ball, then...</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Push the Pace</h2>
        <p>Good defense turns into good offense. In order to take advantage of a strong and persistent defense, the offensive must push the ball up the floor and look to attack.
