		<h1>Past Research</h1>
		<p>
			Mathematics has been my research area since I realized that you could do
			research in mathematics. I am considered to be a pure mathematician (which
			means I study math for the math alone), but that term has started to fall
			out of use. Regardless of my day job, I will always have room for some
			mathematical research. You can find more information on my past projects
			below.
