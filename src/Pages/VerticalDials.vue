		<h1>Vertical Dials</h1>
		<p>
			"Vertical Dials" is a watchface for the
			<a href="http://getpebble.com" target="_blank" title="Pebble Smartwatch">Pebble Smartwatch</a>. It was
			designed and created by me, Donnie. It displays the time using two vertical dials: one for the hour and one
			for the minutes. The dials are on the far left and right of the watch face with room in the middle for the
			date, day of the week, and battery meter. On either dial there is a triangular indicator that points to the
			current hour and minute. For example, the screenshot shows the time 8:50.
			<br><br>
			The thin horizontal black line under the day and year is the battery meter. As the battery drains, the line
			will shorten towards the left. As with my
			<a href="/watchfaces.html" title="Watchfaces">other</a> watchfaces, Vertical dots also has
			bluetooth connection vibration: two short vibrations when a bluetooth connection is established and one long
			vibration when it disconnects.

			The tick marks on the hour (left) side are in increments of one. The marks are labeled with the exception of
			0 (which doesn't really matter), 3,6,9, and 12. The unmarked ticks are given extra-long tick marks. On the
			minute (right) side, the tick marks are in increments of 5. The marks are labeled similarly to the hour
			side.
